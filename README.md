# Final Project - Optimization for Data Science - Data Science MSc. - UniPD
# Giacomo Virginio, Mikhail Kolobov

This github contains the code for the implementation of algorithms from the papers of Sahu et al., Gao et al. and Lobanov et al. regarding optimization in the zeroth order Frank-Wolfe methods.

The basic structure of the github, with the implementation of nn-Carlini on the MNIST dataset and the objective function used are taken from https://github.com/IBM/ZOSVRG-BlackBox-Adv, mentioned for the adversary attack example in Gao et al.; the code for the optimization algorithms can be found inside the optimizatio_methods folder.

There is a folder containing the report, presentation and notebook; the notebook contains the code to run the adversarial attack from a cloud solution (as colab) and the code used to create the graphs present in the report.
